在此，你可以盡情討論任何合法或非法的精神作用性物質如酒精、菸草、電子煙、大麻、草本藥、啟靈藥、致幻藥物、鴉片類藥物、興奮劑、麻醉劑、鎮靜劑、抑制劑、吸入劑及精神科藥物的疑問與體驗。若你是用藥新手，可以安心地發問（如劑量、注意事項等），若你是用藥老手，也可以暢快地分享你的用藥體驗心得（Trip Report）。

就算你沒有任何使用非法藥物的打算，也可以在此與大家交流滿足你的好奇心，而你會驚訝地發現，許多使用非法藥物的人並不是媒體口中的「毒蟲」，這些人其實非常清楚自己在幹嘛的，他們既沒有在傷害自己（相較於菸酒）也沒有傷害別人的打算，他們反而跟你一樣努力上學、工作、生活，只是他們看世界的角度和你不一樣罷了。
